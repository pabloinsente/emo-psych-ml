### Current perspectives in affective computing

Summary review of the main perspective in affective computing research

#### Categorical approach 

Approaches based on categorical view of emotion

#### Continuous approach

Approaches based on continuous view of emotion

#### Mixed approach

Approaches blending categorical and continuous views

### Case studies in affective computing

Analysis of main topics of interest in affective computing

#### Emotion

Studies attempting to predict, recognize, or generate classical emotion labels 

#### Sentiment

Studies attempting to predict, recognize, or generate "sentiment" (i.e., positive, neutral, negative)

#### Mood

Studies attempting to predict, recognize, or generate "mood" (i.e., associated with clinical states like "depression")

### Convergence and divergence between psychological and affective computing perspectives

Comparative analysis from both perspectives. The goal here is to come up with areas of improvement or innovation for future research.

#### Convergence

Analysis of areas of theoretical convergence

#### Divergence

Analysis of areas of theoretical divergence

### Recommendations for future research

Development of concrete recommendations and ideas for future research

### Conclusions

Summary and remarks
