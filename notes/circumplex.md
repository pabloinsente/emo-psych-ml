# Core Affect and the Psychological Construction of Emotion

(Russell, 2003)

"Core affect can therefore be experienced as freefloating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode)"

'The concepts of emotion, fear, anger, and so forth are parts of a folk theory inherited from human shepherding and farming ancestors.'

"especially emotion itself, a word for which does not exist in all languages; Russell, 1991"

"What is an emotion? There is little convergence on an answer and therefore little agreement on where emotion stops and its causes and consequences begin (another perennial question). There are no formal criteria for what is and what is not an emotion."

'My hope is to achieve what Schachter and Singer (1962) set out to accomplish: a synthesis of (a) James’s
(1884) insight that emotion involves a self-perception of automatic processes with (b) modern evidence on the processes involved.'

"Philosophers of mind generally teach that an emotion necessarily has cognitive content, or, more technically, that it has an “intentional” object (Dennett, 1987; Searle, 1982; R. C. Solomon, 1976)"



"Core affect is that neurophysiological state consciously accessible as the simplest raw (nonreflective) feelings evident in moods and emotions. It is similar to what Thayer (1989) called activation, what Watson and Tellegen (1985) called affect, what Morris (1989) called mood, and what is commonly called a feeling. "

"Core affect is primitive, universal, and simple (irreducible on the mental plane). It can exist without being labeled, interpreted, or attributed to any cause. As an analogy, consider felt body temperature. You can note it whenever you want. Extremes can become very salient. Felt temperature exists prior to such words as hot or cold, prior to the concept of temperature, either in folk or scientific theory, and prior to any attribution about what is making you hot or cold. "

"The subjective experience and its neurophysiological counterpart are not separate events but two sides of
the same coin."

"As consciously experienced, core affect is mental but not cognitive or reflective (Zajonc, 2000). Cognitive events, such as beliefs or percepts, are intrinsically about something: They have Objects. In contrast, core affect per se is not about anything."

A person always has core affect: Picture a single point that moves about in Figure 1, responding to events internal and external. Core affect can be neutral (the center point), moderate, or extreme (the periphery). Changes can be short lived or long lasting (as in a clincal depression). Intense core affect can be the focus of
consciousness, but milder core affect is typically a part of the background of the person’s conscious world. Change in core affect, in proportion to its rapidity and extent, fills consciousness. When the feeling weakens or stabilizes, it recedes into the background. When neutral and stable, perhaps core affect disappears altogether from consciousness.

" Here, I pursue a stronger, more interesting and likely more controversial claim, namely, that the processes postulated so far, plus blatantly nonemotional processes, can account for all emotional episodes"

" If these processes exist, then what more must be postulated to account for clear, full-blown, blue-ribbon emotions, what I call prototypical emotional episodes? "

"Bear in mind that the preceding list and its claims concern what typically happens in prototypical cases. In nonprototypical and borderline cases, the story can be quite different. For instance, core affect can be extreme before rather than after the antecedent appears (as in displacement); one can enjoy what one appraises as dangerous (thrill seeking); the antecedent need not be the Object (misattribution); appraisals can be atypical (fear of Objects known to be harmless), and so on."

"To describe emotional life adequately it is necessary to go beyond these prototypes. The ecology of emotional life is not one of long periods of nonemotional “normal” life punctuated by the occasional prototypical emotional episode. A frugal ontology may be all that is needed: Emotional life consists of the continuous fluctuations in core affect, in pervasive perception of affective qualities, and in the frequent attribution of core affect to a single Object, all interacting with perceptual, cognitive, and behavior
processes."
