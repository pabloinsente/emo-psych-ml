# What is an emotion

## Ralph Adolphs

"In my view, emotions are the functional states of the brain that provide causal explanations of certain complex behaviors — like evading a predator or attacking prey [1,2]. I think that there is a single functionally described state for instances of the same emotion category — fear, anger and so on."

"A functional state is defined by what it does, not by how it is actually constituted in the brain, or by the
feelings it may be associated with. As a result, functional states provide objective, public, criteria that make it possible to objectively infer them."

"By my reading, Lisa’s theory is a theory only about the conscious experience of emotion (aka ‘feelings’),
not a theory of emotion per se."

## Lisa Feldman Barret

" In a given moment, my brain might categorize my sense data as an instance of sadness and your brain might categorize the sense data coming from me — my movements, my vocal acoustics, in the same context — as an instance of anger. We can compare our inferences to one another, or what is normative in that particular situation, but there are no objective criteria to say who is right." 

" agree that functions are not arbitrary or unconstrained. But that does not mean functions are
evolutionary in origin. To assume so is teleology, which we know can reflect erroneous causal reasoning (for
example [5]). The important point here is that the evolved function that you assign to an emotion category is the result of human inference"

" agree that functions are not arbitrary or unconstrained. But that does not mean functions are

"Emotions, in my view, are those embodied representations that shape the animal’s action and become the
animal’s experience of the world in that upcoming moment. In humans, the representations may (or may not)
include an explicit awareness of the emotion state, which we colloquially refer to as the ‘emotional experience"

"For an animal to experience emotions like a human, the animal’s brain must be able to make ad hoc emotion concepts like a neurotypical human does."

"I agree with Ralph that an instance of an emotion category, such as anger, is a functional state. But the
available data lead me to hypothesize that the function of anger will vary situationally, depending on the context. For example, studies show that human anger can accomplish purposes as diverse as removing an obstacle that is blocking an important goal, helping to enhance performance to win a competition or a negotiation, allowing a person to appear powerful or signal dominance, or protecting against a hostile threat "

"One difference between our perspectives, I think, is that I propose human inference is necessary to
construct instances of emotion, whereas your view is that human inference identifies instances
of emotion but plays no role in constructing them."

"Scientists who “reliably assign emotion states to animals (and to people) using functional criteria” are simply promoting their inferences to the status of ‘objective’."

"Yes. All existing taxonomies that are anchored in folk psychology categories will have the same problems
and therefore are not a useful guide for scientific investigation."

"My hypothesis is that emotions are categories of social reality [9]. Categories of social reality are rooted in human consensus —shells, rocks, or little pieces of paper become real as money when a group of people
agree to impose a certain function on physical objects (i.e., people agree to trade them for material goods), thereby acting on them or with them in certain ways."

# The ambiguous world of emotion representation

Sethu et al, 2019

"A key reason for this is the lack of a common mathematical framework to describe all the relevant elements of emotion representations"

"This paper proposes the AMBiguous Emotion Representation (AMBER) framework to address this deficiency. AMBER is a unified framework that explicitly describes categorical, numerical and ordinal representations of emotions, including time varying representations."

"However, current emotion recognition systems use models of emotions that are restricted, compared with those that we humans use, which fundamentally limits their utility. "

"Current affective computing systems generally represent emotions with categorical labels (e.g., angry, happy) or as values on numerical scales (e.g., arousal/activation - calm vs. excited, valence - negative vs. positive) [28,68]. There has also been interest in ordinal representations that acknowledge the inherently ordinal characteristic of emotion perception [44,75,76] (e.g., medium valence on a scale of {low, medium, high})."

"Emotion representations need to be capable of reflecting the diversity of human annotation, due to the inherently subjective nature of affective experiences, both while expressing and perceiving emotions."

"Despite this, a single-valued average emotional label has almost always been adopted as the ground truth representation, and modelling the ambiguity as expressed by inter-observer agreement levels within automatic affect analysers remains a noted challenge in the field "

## Current Uses of Affective Computing

"current emotion representations, and indeed machine learning approaches employed in affective computing in general, lack the capability to deal adequately with subjective quantities such as emotions, where the information to be modelled and inferred may be inherently ambiguous."

"(1) emotion perception and (2) emotion synthesis and conversion" or recognition and generation.

## Theories of emotion

Categorical

Circumplex/ Dimensional: 

- Scholsber: pleasantness and attention
- Mehrabian and Russell:  pleasure, arousal and dominance. 
- Scherer, Watson and Tellegen : positive and negative

"It should be noted that the names given to these dimensions are somewhat varied across the different theoretical accounts, with terms activation, arousal, and activity used interchangeably; and similarly valence, pleasure, and evaluation; and dominance and control dimension."

## Computational Representations of Emotion

"From the perspective of automatic emotion recognition, the focus has been largely on seeking representations of emotions (especially in defining constructs that are the targets for computation) that can be derived from observations of emotional expressions. "

**Categorical labels**

**Numerical labels:** "Valence and arousal are the most popular dimensions used in affective computing. They are commonly collected using Likert-type scales. A common survey includes self-assessment manikins (SAMs), non-verbal pictorial representations describing different levels of the emotional attributes"

Ordinal labels are often derived from categorical or numerical labels. However, they can also be directly obtained with perceptual evaluations

## Limitations

"The lack of consensus on a single scheme and the sheer number of various schemes that have been employed reflect the lack of a settled theory of emotions, the complexity of emotions, and the
emphasis of differing properties of emotions in different studies"

## Proposal 

"The AMBER framework can be thought of as broadly comprising of two components: (a) a common representation scheme based on a set of suitable descriptors, which we refer to as attribute descriptors, that can describe all three possible spaces of emotion labels (categorical, numerical and ordinal); and (b) a function based representation of emotion defined on the attribute descriptors to encode ambiguity."

# Comparing supervised and unsupervised approaches to emotion categorization in the human brain, body, and subjective experience.

Azaru et al 2020

"Scientific leaders of the day (e.g., James et al. 1890; Wundt and Judd 1897) warned that these common-sense categories, which philosophers call \folk psychology" (Sellars et al. 1956; Churchland 1989; Stich 1983; Stich and Ravenscroft 1994; Baker 1999), would not map cleanly to physical measurements. Nonetheless, scientists have persisted for more than a century in their attempts to map measurements of the brain, body, and behavior to common-sense mental categories for cognitions, emotions, perceptions and so on. For some scientists, these efforts rely implicitly on the assumption that Western common-sense categories constitute the biological and psychological ‘ground truth’ of the human mind across all cultures."

"We conclude the paper with a set of recommendations and future directions for machine learning investigations to guide researchers towards using unsupervised methods to discover biologically meaningful and reproducible discoveries about the nature of emotion and the human mind more generally"

"Classifiers that are sensitive and specific to a distinct emotion category across participants and contexts (Kragel et al. 2018) are then taken as evidence that the patterns or class representatives that those classifiers determine are the biomarkers of the categories."

"To the extent that these studies have identified markers that are truly representative of different emotion categories, and generalize across populations and contexts, these studies may be taken by researchers as evidence that emotion categories have a reliable biological and mental basis."

"In our view, however, the variability of patterns across studies signals an opportunity for discovery (Firestein 2015, 2012) with respect to the nature of emotion."

"A second reason to question whether biology and behavior are best accounted for by a single set of emotion categories, each with a single biomarker, comes from evidence of considerable within-category variability and cross-category similarity in measurements of neural activity, ANS activity, and behavior."

"People vary in their physical actions across instances of the same emotion category that occur in different situations (e.g., when experiencing fear, a person may run away, freeze, or attack); as a consequence, instances of fear will vary in their physiological features (Siegel et al. 2018)"

"This magnitude of variation, which has been replicated numerous times in the study of emotion over the past century (Gendron and Feldman Barrett 2009) strengthens the possibility that imposing a single label on data may restrict or even obscure the discovery of meaningful, alternative categories in the emotion domain."

"First, it is possible that the emotion category labels used in these three datasets (and most past studies of emotion categories) veridically reflect biological and psychological categories that exist in nature and are stable across contexts and individuals, and that latent emotion constructs do in fact, produce distinct, if graded, responses in brain, body, and behavior. If this possibility is correct, then we would expect above- chance accuracy for supervised classification because there is some reliable signal in the data that can be classified. " Or just the model it's pretty bad? 

## Implications

"First, there is increased burden on researchers using supervised learning with category labels to think about and empirically explore the validity of their labels, and potential constraints in their stimulus sets and methods, rather than assuming that the labels are the ground truth and then sampling with that assumed prototype or stereotype in mind."

"To cultivate a robust and replicable science, researchers must design studies in a way that allows for an explicit test of whether the a priori labels are the best way to estimate the structure in their data. Specifically, it
 would be optimal to sample many domains of features at higher dimensionality. This would include sampling biological and psychological features in the same study in a temporally sensitive way. An ideal study would measure a person’s internal context (e.g., the person’s metabolic condition, the past experiences that come to mind) and external context (e.g., whether a person is at work, school, or home, who else is present, broader cultural conditions). In addition to measuring internal and external context, an ideal study would also measure a broad set of mental features that might describe an instance of emotion, such as appraisal features (how the situation is experienced; e.g., as novel or familiar, requiring effort, or conducive to one’s goals, etc; Clore and Ortony 2008, 2013) and functional features (the goals that a person is attempting to meet during the instance; e.g., to avoid a predator, to feel closer to someone, to win a competition, to gain social approval, etc; Adolphs 2017; Lazarus and Lazarus 1991), all of which vary in dynamic ways over time. Combining these measures with an objective, empirical way of sampling stimulus events (as in Hoemann et al. under review) would provide an optimal way to accurately capture and interpret meaningful structure in machine learning analyses of emotion."

"We recommend that researchers routinely compare supervised and unsupervised approaches on their data and report both or at least use multiple supervised classification algorithms or feature selection methods on the same dataset to explore implications of methodological decisions on their solutions."

# What is Meant by Calling Emotions Basic

Ekman and Cordaro, 2011

"Emotions are discrete, automatic responses to universally shared, culture-specific and individual-specific events. The emotion terms, such as anger, fear, etcetera, denote a family of related states sharing at least 12 characteristics, which distinguish one emotion family from another, as well as from other affective states. These affective responses are preprogrammed and involuntary, but are also shaped by life experiences."

"The data for discrete emotions includes facial, vocal, autonomic physiology, and study of the events that precede one or another emotion (Ekman & Davidson, 1994)."

"The second characteristic embodied in the adjective “basic” is the view that emotions have evolved through adaptation to our surroundings. "

"In addition to this phylogenetic contribution to the nature of each basic emotion, there is also an ontogenetic contribution, the product of social learning, very impactful early in life but with continuing contributions over the life course. "

"Each emotion is not a single affective or psychological state but rather a family of related states."
